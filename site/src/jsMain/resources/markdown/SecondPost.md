# Building Components with Silk

Welcome to the second post in our Kobweb series! Today we'll explore Silk, Kobweb's powerful UI framework.

## What is Silk?

Silk is Kobweb's component library that provides:

- Pre-built UI components
- Theming support
- Responsive design utilities
- CSS-in-Kotlin styling

## Creating Your First Component

Components in Silk are composable functions that render UI elements. They follow a declarative pattern that's easy to
understand and maintain.

## Styling with Silk

Silk provides several ways to style your components:

1. **Built-in modifiers** - Common styling patterns
2. **Custom styles** - Your own CSS rules
3. **Theme integration** - Consistent design system
4. **Responsive utilities** - Mobile-first design

## Component Composition

One of Silk's strengths is component composition. You can combine simple components to create complex UI patterns.

## Best Practices

When building with Silk:

- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use the theming system consistently
- Leverage built-in responsive utilities
- Test your components across different screen sizes

## Next Steps

In the next post, we'll dive deeper into advanced Silk patterns and explore how to build a complete page layout.
