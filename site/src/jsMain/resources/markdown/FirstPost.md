# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I'm excited to share my journey with **Kotlin** and **Kobweb**.

## What is Kobweb?

Kobweb is a modern framework for building full-stack web applications using Kotlin and Compose HTML. It allows
developers to write both frontend and backend code in Kotlin.

### Key Features

- **Type Safety**: Everything is type-safe
- **Hot Reloading**: Fast development cycle
- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Share code between frontend and backend

## Getting Started

To get started with Kobweb, you can:

1. Install the Kobweb CLI
2. Create a new project
3. Start developing!

```kotlin
@Page
@Composable
fun HomePage() {
    Text("Hello, Kobweb!")
}
```

That's it for now. More posts coming soon!
